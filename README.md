Our team seeks to understand the relationship between climate change and the 15 different community types that our sponsor, the American Communities Project, has identified. Working with climate data provided by USAFacts, we seek to analyze and understand temperature/precipitation data, as well as income data, to see if we can identify significant relationships between specific communities and climate change. Our website contains data visualizations which will assist journalists in telling the story behind these communities and drawing conclusions about their impact on the climate. The functionality of our website and tools include: 
- **Interactive Map Visualizations** that represent data about 
    - 21st century average temperatures, with the ability to filter by community type, state, county name, and season.
    - 21st century average percipitations, with the ability to filter by community type, state, county name, and season.
    - a map visualizing the median income in each county in the USA from the 20st century, with the ability to filter by median income, community type, county name, and state.
    - a map that visualizes the location of all of the different community types. You can filter by Community Type and State to get a better idea of where each community type is located.

- **Percent Change Analysis Graph**: This visualization is designed to show the percent change in various climate patterns from the 20th Century Average. This horizontal bar chart is interactive and when the user hovers over one of the bars, the respective community type overview will be shown in order to see the change over the 20 years of the 21st Century. The user can toggle between temperature and precipitation as well as change the year.
- **Temperature Vs Income by County**: This visualization shows an overview of the percent temperature change in each county in the United States, plotted on Percent Deviation from 20th Century Median Tempertaure and Median 20th century Income (with data from the U.S. census). Interactivity includes filtering by state and year.
